  <h1>JMS test report</h1>
  <h2>Correctness</h2>
  <p>This part focuses on correctness. It is only valid for tests performed with the tools and with the id option
    enabled. The goal is to ensure that the messaging platform delivers every message exactly once.
  <p>A lost message is, well, gone. Sent but not received. It may be truly lost, it may have been moved to a dead
    letter queue or the id property may have been lost. Without the id property the message becomes an alien.
  <p>A duplicate message has been delivered and (more importantly) committed by the consumer at least twice.
  <p>A ghost message has been sent but rolled back; if ghost messages are found something is seriously wrong. Yet it
    happens.
  <p>An alien message is a message without the properties set by the producer. In a correctness test where the
    consumer is used with the producer and with the id property set, there should be none. For a performance test where
    messages are generated without the id property they are normal.
  <p>An undead message has never been sent, but yet it is not alien. Most likely a log file from another test has
    been imported, but it is also possible that a message got through without being logged when a producer was killed.
    That may be correct, or it may be problematic. If there are unexplained undead messages present, keep testing and
    find out why.
  <h3>Lost messages</h3>
  {lostMessageReport}

  <h3>Duplicate messages</h3>
  {duplicateMessageReport}

  <h3>Ghost messages</h3>
  {ghostMessageReport}

  <h3>Alien messages</h3>
  {alienMessageReport}

  <h3>Undead messages</h3>
  {undeadMessageReport}

  <h2>Performance</h2>
  <p>This part focuses on performance. It covers throughput (consumed and produced messages per minute) as well as
    flight time. Be careful not to make hasty conclusions based on the figures. Performance can vary a lot with message
    sizes, transaction policies, the number of threads, the number of queues and so on. With that said, here is the
    data.
  <h3>Throughput</h3>

  <h4>Produced</h4>
  {producedPerMinuteTable}

  <h4>Consumed</h4>
  {consumedPerMinuteTable}
  
  <h3>Flight time</h3>
  <p>The flight times are measured in milliseconds between the produced and consumed times
  as opposed to the two commit times. Percentiles are computed by picking the closest
  real value without any interpolation, so for tests with few messages per minute they
  will be inaccurate.
